# Summer Hack Night 2013 Curriculum

We're going to refer to each section of the Hack Night curriculum as a "week" because that's how we have it structured, however each topic won't necessary last a week.

## Week 0:  [Background](https://github.com/isislab/Hack-Night#week-0-background)
Just some basics here.  Watch the PicoCTF videos.  Read a bit of the textbook chapter until you get bored.  The Security Principles and the Secure Coding Principles are highly recommended, try to understand these as well as you can.  If these principles don't make sense now, they'll become clearer throughout the summer.  If reverse engineering and low level programming excite you, we recommend you watch as much of The Hardware/Software Interface class as you can, so you're ready to go when we hit week 6.

### Homework
Your homework for week 0 is this PicoCTF challenge, Python Eval 1.  Feel free to check some other easier challenges from PicoCTF as well.  Remember to use the IRC channel for questions/support.

## Week 1:  [Introduction](https://github.com/isislab/Hack-Night#week-1-introduction)
An introduction to Hack Night.  A little bit about vulnerability disclosure, and a little bit about ethics.  Two videos about what you'll learn over the summer, and how it all fits together.  The most important part of week 1 is checking out all our resources and trying to determine what you want to take away from this program.  What topics you want to focus on, what projects you want to work on, what you want to learn, what skills you want to master.

### Homework
Your homework for week 1 is to pick a project and a research topic.  This is the same task we typically give to students who are graduating from Hack Night, so if you're unsure, it's okay!  Ask a mentor in IRC for help.  We recommend you look for bugs in software, also known as vulnerability research.

## Week 2:  [Source Code Analysis](https://github.com/isislab/Hack-Night#week-2-code-auditing)
This is an introduction to Source Code Analysis.  Watch all three lectures and check out the resources.  If you aren't familiar with [C](https://github.com/isislab/Project-Ideas/wiki/Programming#c) or [PHP](https://github.com/isislab/Project-Ideas/wiki/Programming#php), you can learn them from resources [here](https://github.com/isislab/Project-Ideas/wiki/Programming).  Don't spend too much time learning the language, just enough so you can understand the lecture.

### [Homework](https://github.com/isislab/Hack-Night#week-3-code-auditing-workshop)
Try to find bugs in all three workshop materials.  If you need any help, ask a mentor.
