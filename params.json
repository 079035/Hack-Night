{"name":"ISIS Lab's Hack Night","tagline":"An intense introduction to offensive security","body":"Developed out of the materials from NYU Poly's old [Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis course](http://pentest.cryptocity.net/), Hack Night is a sobering introduction to offensive security.  A lot of complex technical content is covered very quickly as students are introduced to a wide variety of complex and immersive topics.\r\n\r\n*Due to the involved nature of this course, we only recommend students attend Hack Night in person.*\r\n\r\nHack Night culminates in a practical application of the skills learned in the form of a research project inspired by one of the lectures or exercise materials.  Each student is expected to have a good understanding of all topics and a mastery of at least one topic by the end of the course.\r\n\r\n### Topics\r\n* Source Code Auditing\r\n* Web Security\r\n* Reverse Engineering\r\n* Exploitation\r\n* Post-Exploitation\r\n* Application Security\r\n\r\n### Lecturers, in order of appearance\r\n* [Brandon Edwards](https://twitter.com/drraid), [Exodus Intelligence](https://www.exodusintel.com/)\r\n* Joe Hemler, [Gotham Digital Science](http://www.gdssecurity.com/)\r\n* [Marcin Wielgoszewski](https://twitter.com/marcinw), [Matasano](http://www.matasano.com/)\r\n* [Aaron Portnoy](https://twitter.com/aaronportnoy), [Exodus Intelligence](https://www.exodusintel.com/)\r\n* [Alexander Sotirov](https://twitter.com/alexsotirov/), [Trail of Bits](http://www.phreedom.org/)\r\n* Xeno Kovah, [MITRE](http://www.mitre.org/)\r\n* [Dino Dai Zovi](https://twitter.com/dinodaizovi), [Trail of Bits](http://www.phreedom.org/)\r\n* Colin Ames, [Attack Research](http://www.attackresearch.com/)\r\n* [Mike Zusman](https://twitter.com/schmoilito), [Carve Systems](http://www.carvesystems.com/)\r\n\r\n### Curators\r\n* Evan Jensen\r\n* Marc Budofsky\r\n\r\n#### Past Curators\r\n* Julian Cohen\r\n* Nitin Jami","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
