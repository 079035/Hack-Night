{"name":"ISIS Lab's Hack Night","tagline":"An intense introduction to offensive security","body":"Developed from the materials of NYU Poly's old Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis course, Hack Night is a sobering introduction to offensive security.  A lot of complex technical content is covered very quickly as students are introduced to a wide variety of complex and immersive topics over thirteen weeks.\r\n\r\n*Due to the involved nature of this course, we recommend students attend Hack Night in person.*\r\n\r\nHack Night culminates in a practical application of the skills and techniques taught, students complete a research project inspired by one of the lectures or exercise materials.  By the end of the course, each student is expected to have a good understanding of all topics and a mastery of at least one topic.\r\n\r\nHack Night is developed by students and friends of the [ISIS Lab](http://www.isis.poly.edu/).\r\n\r\n## Topics\r\n* Source Code Auditing\r\n* Web Security\r\n* Reverse Engineering\r\n* Exploitation\r\n* Post-Exploitation\r\n* Application Security\r\n\r\n## Lecturers, *in order of appearance*\r\n* [**Brandon Edwards**](https://twitter.com/drraid), [Exodus Intelligence](https://www.exodusintel.com/)\r\n* **Joe Hemler**, [Gotham Digital Science](http://www.gdssecurity.com/)\r\n* [**Marcin Wielgoszewski**](https://twitter.com/marcinw), [Matasano](http://www.matasano.com/)\r\n* [**Aaron Portnoy**](https://twitter.com/aaronportnoy), [Exodus Intelligence](https://www.exodusintel.com/)\r\n* [**Alexander Sotirov**](https://twitter.com/alexsotirov/), [Trail of Bits](http://www.phreedom.org/)\r\n* **Xeno Kovah**, [MITRE](http://www.mitre.org/)\r\n* [**Dino Dai Zovi**](https://twitter.com/dinodaizovi), [Trail of Bits](http://www.phreedom.org/)\r\n* **Colin Ames**, [Attack Research](http://www.attackresearch.com/)\r\n* [**Mike Zusman**](https://twitter.com/schmoilito), [Carve Systems](http://www.carvesystems.com/)\r\n\r\n## Curators\r\n* [Evan Jensen](https://twitter.com/evanpauljensen)\r\n* [Marc Budofsky](https://twitter.com/marcbudofsky)\r\n\r\n### Past Curators\r\n* [Julian Cohen](https://twitter.com/HockeyInJune)\r\n* [Nitin Jami](https://twitter.com/nitinJami)\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n**Mailing List**:  [csc@isis.poly.edu](https://isis.poly.edu/mailman/listinfo/csc)  \r\n**IRC**:  [#hacknight on isis.poly.edu port 6697 (ssl only)](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=isis.poly.edu%3A%2B6697&channel=%23hacknight)  \r\n**Github**:  https://github.com/isislab/  \r\n**Project Ideas**:  https://github.com/isislab/Project-Ideas/issues\r\n\r\n## Sign up\r\nSign up to attend Hack Night.
